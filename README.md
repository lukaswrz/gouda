# gouda

This repository provides two Go packages: file serving over HTTP (`godl`) and
upload scheduling for multi-part uploads (`upsched`). These utilities are
designed to streamline file handling operations in web applications, with
features like MIME type inference, content disposition, and multi-part upload
management.
